        **Overview**

        Elo rating is a rating system based on pairwise comparisons. Ratings are given to competitors based on their
        comparisons (bouts) with peers, in which they can win, lose or tie. The change in a players rating is scaled by
        the rating difference between them and their competitor.

        **Basic Usage**

        .. code-block:: python

            from elote import EloCompetitor
            good = EloCompetitor(initial_rating=400)
            better = EloCompetitor(initial_rating=500)
            better.beat(good)
            print('probability of better beating good: %5.2f%%' % (better.expected_score(good) * 100, ))


        **Class Variables**

        Class variables are configured for all competitors in a population, not on a per-competitor basis. See the
        documentation on ``Arenas`` to see how to set these safely.

         * _base_rating: defaults to 400.
         * _k_factor: tunes the speed of response to new information, higher is faster response. Default=32

        In Elo rating, a player's expected score is their probability of winning plus half their probability of drawing.

        half of a loss. It can make the expected score a bit difficult to reason about, so be careful.
