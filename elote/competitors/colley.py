Colley Matrix Method implementation for the Elote library.

The Colley Matrix Method is a least-squares rating system developed by Dr. Wesley Colley
that solves a system of linear equations to obtain rankings. It's widely used in sports
rankings, particularly college football.

    The Colley Matrix Method is a least-squares rating system that solves a system of linear

    Colley Matrix recalculates all ratings using the entire match history.

    Key characteristics:
    - Bias-free (doesn't depend on schedule order)
    - Considers only wins and losses (not margin of victory)
    - Initial rating of 0.5 for all competitors
    - Final ratings are between 0 and 1
    - Sum of all ratings equals n/2 (where n is number of competitors)

    Class Attributes:
        _minimum_rating (float): The minimum allowed rating value. Default: 0.0
