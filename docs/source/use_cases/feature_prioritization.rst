Feature Prioritization with Elote
============================

Overview
--------

Feature prioritization is a critical challenge in product management and software development. With limited resources and time, teams must decide which features to build first to maximize value. Traditional prioritization methods like scoring rubrics or the RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) have limitations:

- They often rely on subjective numerical scores
- Different stakeholders may interpret scoring criteria differently
- It's difficult to maintain consistency across many features
- Comparing features directly is often more intuitive than scoring them individually

Elote offers an elegant solution through pairwise comparison-based ranking. By having stakeholders compare features directly against each other, you can build a more reliable and consensus-driven prioritization system.

This guide demonstrates how to use Elote for effective feature prioritization.

Basic Implementation
------------------

Let's start with a simple implementation using the Elo rating system:

.. code-block:: python

    from elote import EloCompetitor
    import json
    
    class FeaturePrioritizer:
        def __init__(self):
            self.features = {}
            
        def add_feature(self, feature_id, name, description, initial_rating=1500):
            """Add a feature to the prioritization system"""
            if feature_id not in self.features:
                self.features[feature_id] = {
                    'id': feature_id,
                    'name': name,
                    'description': description,
                    'competitor': EloCompetitor(initial_rating=initial_rating),
                    'comparisons': 0
                }
            return self.features[feature_id]
            
        def record_comparison(self, winner_id, loser_id):
            """Record the result of a feature comparison"""
            if winner_id not in self.features or loser_id not in self.features:
                raise ValueError("Both features must be added to the system first")
                
            # Update ratings
            self.features[winner_id]['competitor'].beat(self.features[loser_id]['competitor'])
            
            # Update comparison counts
            self.features[winner_id]['comparisons'] += 1
            self.features[loser_id]['comparisons'] += 1
            
        def get_prioritized_list(self, min_comparisons=3):
            """Get a prioritized list of features"""
            # Only include features with sufficient comparisons
            valid_features = [f for f in self.features.values() if f['comparisons'] >= min_comparisons]
            
            # Sort by rating (descending)
            valid_features.sort(key=lambda f: f['competitor'].rating, reverse=True)
            
            return [
                {
                    'id': f['id'],
                    'name': f['name'],
                    'description': f['description'],
                    'rating': f['competitor'].rating,
                    'comparisons': f['comparisons']
                }
                for f in valid_features
            ]
            
        def get_next_comparison(self):
            """Get the next most informative comparison to make"""
            import random
            
            # Simple strategy: find features with similar ratings
            features_list = list(self.features.values())
            if len(features_list) < 2:
                return None
                
            # Sort by number of comparisons (ascending)
            features_list.sort(key=lambda f: f['comparisons'])
            
            # Take the two least-compared features
            if features_list[0]['comparisons'] < 5:
                return (features_list[0]['id'], features_list[1]['id'])
                
            # Otherwise, find features with similar ratings
            features_list.sort(key=lambda f: f['competitor'].rating)
            
            # Find adjacent features with closest ratings
            min_diff = float('inf')
            best_pair = None
            
            for i in range(len(features_list) - 1):
                diff = abs(features_list[i]['competitor'].rating - features_list[i+1]['competitor'].rating)
                if diff < min_diff:
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_pair = (features_list[i]['id'], features_list[i+1]['id'])
                    
            return best_pair
    
    # Usage example
    prioritizer = FeaturePrioritizer()
    
    # Add features
    prioritizer.add_feature("f1", "User Authentication", "Allow users to sign up and log in")
    prioritizer.add_feature("f2", "Dashboard", "Create a dashboard with key metrics")
    prioritizer.add_feature("f3", "Export to CSV", "Add ability to export data to CSV")
    prioritizer.add_feature("f4", "Dark Mode", "Add a dark mode theme option")
    prioritizer.add_feature("f5", "Mobile App", "Create a mobile app version")
    
    # Record some comparisons
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f1", "f3")  # Auth is more important than CSV export
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f1", "f4")  # Auth is more important than Dark Mode
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f2", "f3")  # Dashboard is more important than CSV export
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f2", "f4")  # Dashboard is more important than Dark Mode
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f5", "f4")  # Mobile App is more important than Dark Mode
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f1", "f2")  # Auth is more important than Dashboard
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f5", "f3")  # Mobile App is more important than CSV export
    prioritizer.record_comparison("f1", "f5")  # Auth is more important than Mobile App
    
    # Get prioritized list
    prioritized = prioritizer.get_prioritized_list()
    for i, feature in enumerate(prioritized, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {feature['name']} (Rating: {feature['rating']:.1f})")

Collecting Comparison Data
------------------------

There are several ways to collect feature comparison data:

1. **Stakeholder Voting**: Have stakeholders vote on pairs of features
2. **Team Meetings**: Conduct structured prioritization sessions
3. **User Research**: Ask users to compare feature importance
4. **Automated Surveys**: Send regular comparison questions to stakeholders

Here's an example of a simple web interface for collecting stakeholder votes:

.. code-block:: html

    <div class="feature-comparison">
      <h2>Which feature is more important?</h2>
      
      <div class="feature-options">
        <div class="feature" onclick="recordPreference('f1')">
          <h3>User Authentication</h3>
          <p>Allow users to sign up and log in</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="feature" onclick="recordPreference('f2')">
          <h3>Dashboard</h3>
          <p>Create a dashboard with key metrics</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script>
    function recordPreference(preferredFeatureId) {
      const otherFeatureId = preferredFeatureId === 'f1' ? 'f2' : 'f1';
      
      // Send data to your backend
      fetch('/api/record-preference', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          winner: preferredFeatureId,
          loser: otherFeatureId,
          voter: currentUserId,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        })
      });
      
      // Load the next comparison
      loadNextComparison();
    }
    </script>

Advanced Implementation: Multi-Criteria Prioritization
---------------------------------------------------

In real-world scenarios, features are often evaluated on multiple criteria such as:

- Business value
- User value
- Implementation effort
- Technical risk
- Strategic alignment

We can use Elote's Ensemble rating system to combine these criteria:

.. code-block:: python

    from elote import EnsembleCompetitor, EloCompetitor
    
    class MultiCriteriaFeaturePrioritizer:
        def __init__(self, criteria=None, weights=None):
            self.features = {}
            
            # Default criteria and weights if not provided
            self.criteria = criteria or ["business_value", "user_value", "effort", "risk"]
            self.weights = weights or [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
            
            # Validate weights sum to 1
            if abs(sum(self.weights) - 1.0) > 0.001:
                raise ValueError("Weights must sum to 1.0")
                
            if len(self.criteria) != len(self.weights):
                raise ValueError("Must provide a weight for each criterion")
            
        def add_feature(self, feature_id, name, description):
            """Add a feature to the prioritization system"""
            if feature_id not in self.features:
                # Create a competitor for each criterion
                rating_systems = []
                for criterion, weight in zip(self.criteria, self.weights):
                    rating_systems.append((EloCompetitor(initial_rating=1500), weight))
                
                self.features[feature_id] = {
                    'id': feature_id,
                    'name': name,
                    'description': description,
                    'competitor': EnsembleCompetitor(rating_systems=rating_systems),
                    'comparisons': {criterion: 0 for criterion in self.criteria},
                    'total_comparisons': 0
                }
            return self.features[feature_id]
            
        def record_comparison(self, winner_id, loser_id, criterion=None):
            """
            Record a comparison result
            If criterion is None, update the ensemble rating
            If criterion is specified, update only that criterion's rating
            """
            if winner_id not in self.features or loser_id not in self.features:
                raise ValueError("Both features must be added to the system first")
                
            winner = self.features[winner_id]
            loser = self.features[loser_id]
            
            if criterion is None:
                # Update the ensemble rating
                winner['competitor'].beat(loser['competitor'])
                winner['total_comparisons'] += 1
                loser['total_comparisons'] += 1
            elif criterion in self.criteria:
                # Update a specific criterion
                criterion_index = self.criteria.index(criterion)
                
                # Get the specific rating system
                winner_rating_system = winner['competitor'].rating_systems[criterion_index][0]
                loser_rating_system = loser['competitor'].rating_systems[criterion_index][0]
                
                # Update the rating
                winner_rating_system.beat(loser_rating_system)
                
                # Update comparison count for this criterion
                winner['comparisons'][criterion] += 1
                loser['comparisons'][criterion] += 1
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Unknown criterion: {criterion}")
                
        def get_prioritized_list(self, min_comparisons=3):
            """Get a prioritized list of features"""
            # Only include features with sufficient comparisons
            valid_features = [
                f for f in self.features.values() 
                if f['total_comparisons'] >= min_comparisons
            ]
            
            # Sort by ensemble rating (descending)
            valid_features.sort(key=lambda f: f['competitor'].rating, reverse=True)
            
            result = []
            for f in valid_features:
                # Get individual criterion ratings
                criterion_ratings = {}
                for i, criterion in enumerate(self.criteria):
                    rating_system = f['competitor'].rating_systems[i][0]
                    criterion_ratings[criterion] = rating_system.rating
                    
                result.append({
                    'id': f['id'],
                    'name': f['name'],
                    'description': f['description'],
                    'overall_rating': f['competitor'].rating,
                    'criterion_ratings': criterion_ratings,
                    'comparisons': f['comparisons'],
                    'total_comparisons': f['total_comparisons']
                })
                
            return result

Handling Stakeholder Disagreement
-------------------------------

Different stakeholders often have different priorities. Here are strategies to handle this:

1. **Separate Rankings**: Maintain separate rankings for different stakeholder groups
2. **Weighted Voting**: Give different weights to different stakeholders
3. **Consensus Building**: Use the comparison process to drive discussion and consensus

Here's an example of weighted voting:

.. code-block:: python

    def record_weighted_comparison(self, winner_id, loser_id, voter_id, voter_weights=None):
        """Record a comparison with different weights for different voters"""
        if voter_weights is None:
            # Default weights by role
            voter_weights = {
                "executive": 2.0,
                "product_manager": 1.5,
                "engineer": 1.0,
                "designer": 1.0,
                "sales": 0.8
            }
            
        # Get voter's role
        voter_role = self.get_voter_role(voter_id)
        weight = voter_weights.get(voter_role, 1.0)
        
        # Apply the comparison multiple times based on weight
        full_weight = int(weight)
        for _ in range(full_weight):
            self.record_comparison(winner_id, loser_id)
            
        # Handle fractional weight
        fractional_weight = weight - full_weight
        if random.random() < fractional_weight:
            self.record_comparison(winner_id, loser_id)

Visualizing Prioritization Results
--------------------------------

Visualization helps stakeholders understand and buy into the prioritization results:

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    def visualize_prioritization(prioritized_features, top_n=10):
        """Create a visualization of the prioritization results"""
        # Take top N features
        features = prioritized_features[:top_n]
        
        # Extract data
        names = [f['name'] for f in features]
        ratings = [f['rating'] for f in features]
        
        # Create horizontal bar chart
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
        y_pos = np.arange(len(names))
        
        plt.barh(y_pos, ratings, align='center')
        plt.yticks(y_pos, names)
        plt.xlabel('Rating')
        plt.title('Feature Priority Ranking')
        
        # Add rating values at the end of each bar
        for i, v in enumerate(ratings):
            plt.text(v + 10, i, f"{v:.1f}", va='center')
            
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.savefig('feature_prioritization.png')
        plt.close()
        
        return 'feature_prioritization.png'

Real-World Applications
---------------------

Organizations using pairwise comparison for feature prioritization include:

- **Microsoft**: Uses similar techniques for Windows feature prioritization
- **Atlassian**: Incorporates pairwise voting in their product planning
- **Spotify**: Uses comparison-based methods for roadmap planning
- **IBM**: Employs similar techniques for enterprise software features

Best Practices
------------

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a manageable set of features (15-20)
2. **Involve Key Stakeholders**: Ensure all perspectives are represented
3. **Provide Context**: Give voters sufficient information about each feature
4. **Regular Updates**: Re-prioritize regularly as new information emerges
5. **Combine Methods**: Use Elote alongside other prioritization frameworks
6. **Document Decisions**: Record the reasoning behind key prioritization decisions
7. **Consider Dependencies**: Factor in technical dependencies between features

Conclusion
---------

Elote provides a powerful framework for implementing feature prioritization systems based on pairwise comparisons. This approach offers several advantages over traditional scoring methods:

- More intuitive for stakeholders (comparing is easier than scoring)
- Reduces individual bias through multiple comparisons
- Creates a clear, defensible ranking
- Adapts as new features are added
- Builds consensus through the comparison process

By leveraging Elote's implementation of sophisticated rating systems, you can build robust feature prioritization solutions that help your team focus on delivering the highest-value features first.
